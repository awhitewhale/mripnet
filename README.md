Code for the paper: **Multi-modal Image Reflection Removal with Prior Knowledge of Reflection Structure Inconsistency**

## üìú Abstract
When capturing images through transparent media such as glass, unwanted reflections can significantly affect image clarity and information accuracy. To address this issue, we propose the **Multi-modal Reflection-structure Inconsistency Prior Network (MRIP-Net)**, which leverages prior knowledge of reflection structure inconsistency to effectively integrate RGB and near-infrared (NIR) image information, enhancing image reflection removal performance.

MRIP-Net features:
- **Shallow Feature Acquisition Module (SFAM)**
- **Deep Feature Encoding Module (DFEM)**
- **Reflection Suppression Attention Mechanism (RSAM)**

Through multi-level feature extraction, fusion, and reconstruction, MRIP-Net generates high-quality reflection-free images. Additionally, we have constructed a new multi-modal RGB-NIR image reflection removal dataset (MIRR dataset), providing a reliable benchmark for research and evaluation of image reflection removal algorithms. Experimental results show that MRIP-Net significantly outperforms other methods in the image reflection removal task.
